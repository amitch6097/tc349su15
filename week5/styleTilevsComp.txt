Personally, I don’t like doing the style tile at all.  I find it to hard to actually put together and then implement.  I would rather jump into the comp and laying out things the way I think they should be, changing things as necessary.  With a style tile you can’t get the full view of what things are going to look like actually next to each other in place making it hard to pick colors or textures.  I spent way more time on the style tiles, but thats just because of the hassle of doing them.  I think it would have been more effective for me to use that time actually making the comp and changing things as need be.  When something doesn’t look good next to one another, its not productive to be stuck to this style tile, it is easier to just make the slight change when necessary.
